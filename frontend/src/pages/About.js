              Hello i am Kateryna Lisabeth from Ukraine and i live in Belgium.
              <br />I was always interested in web development, and last year
              with <big>HackYourFuture Belgium</big> i received an opportunity
              to start new carrier path. In a short 8 month i have managed to
              learn full-stack web development skills. I have progressed from
              "Hello World", to be able to make a full stack application. And
              now i am looking for an opportunity to join a company team and
              start a journey as a young front-end developer.
              <br />
              Available to start immediately
